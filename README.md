## Development Summary

### Approach and Workflow

The development process followed a methodical, incremental approach guided by test-driven development principles. AI assistance (ChatGPT) was utilized to support planning, code generation, and refinement through iterative collaboration.

Key steps included:

* Defining technical constraints and requirements (Node.js, TypeScript, pnpm, Jest).
* Establishing project scaffolding based on best practices.
* Implementing core logic and validating functionality with unit tests.
* Maintaining consistent commit history using the Conventional Commits specification with gitmoji enhancements.

### Technology Stack

* **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
* **Runtime**: Node.js
* **Package Manager**: pnpm
* **Testing Framework**: Jest
* **Tooling**: ts-node, ts-jest, ESLint, Prettier

### Project Structure and Naming Conventions

The project follows a modular and idiomatic file structure:

```
src/
  models/
    stock.ts
    portfolio.ts
  index.ts
tests/
  portfolio.spec.ts
  stock.spec.ts
```

* Folder and file names use `kebab-case` for consistency.
* Class and interface names use `PascalCase` to align with TypeScript conventions.
* Commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format, enhanced with gitmoji for clarity.

### Best Practices Applied

**Code Readability**

* Clear interfaces (`Stock`, `Portfolio`, `Holding`, `Allocation`) with descriptive variable names and inline comments.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**

* Use of `Map` collections ensures constant-time access to holdings and allocations.
* Redundant computations are avoided by processing data in a single pass where possible.
* A tolerance threshold (`1e-6`) is used to manage floating-point precision issues.

**Validation and Robustness**

* Allocation inputs are validated to ensure they sum to 100%.
* Logic accounts for edge cases, including zero holdings and missing allocations.

**Extensibility**

* The `Stock` class abstracts price retrieval through the `getCurrentPrice()` method, enabling future integration with real-time pricing APIs.

**Testing**

* Unit tests cover key scenarios, including:

    * Balanced portfolios
    * Rebalancing logic
    * Partial or missing holdings
    * Invalid allocation inputs
* Identified edge cases (e.g., division by zero) are handled and tested.

**Documentation**

* Usage examples are provided in the entry file (`index.ts`).
* Logic is annotated with comments to support developer onboarding and maintenance.

### Commit History Overview

The Git commit history reflects a structured and disciplined approach:

1. `ðŸ”§ chore`: Initial project setup and configuration.
2. `âœ¨ feat`: Implementation of core models and rebalancing logic.
3. `âœ¨ feat`: Addition of a basic usage example in the entry point.
4. `âœ… test`: Development of comprehensive unit tests for models and logic.
